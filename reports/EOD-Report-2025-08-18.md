# RingCentral Team Chat Summary: August 2025

This blog post summarizes key decisions, action items, and discussions from the RingCentral team chat during August 2025.

## Key Decisions:

* **Executive Sponsorship Feedback Due:** The team must populate the TAM Feedback column in the Executive Sponsorship spreadsheet by COB July 31st.
* **SSO Enablement for Userhub:** Single Sign-On (SSO) login will be enabled for all RingCentral users across Userhub instances on August 14th, impacting logins on August 15th.
* **Freyja Account Process Change:**  The team will no longer resume disabled Freyja accounts with a CSM listed in SFDC, per direction from leadership and legal.  Workarounds are provided for port-out scenarios.
* **Q3 NPS Survey Opt-Outs:** The deadline for survey opt-outs was August 8th, but the team can still opt-in customers or those who changed their mind.  Pre-survey outreach continues through August 22nd.
* **SFDC Tasks for PS to TAM Handoff:**  In Q4, PS to TAM handoff will be a TAM KPI. The team should practice completing the associated SFDC tasks this quarter.
