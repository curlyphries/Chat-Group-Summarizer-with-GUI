## CXOne Team Meeting: Action Items and Key Discussions

This blog post summarizes our recent team meeting, highlighting key decisions, action items, and important discussions.

**Key Decisions:**

* **No decision was made regarding the feature request for overage alerts.** Steve Mueller will investigate existing feature requests, and encourages team members to vote and add customer requests for this functionality. Adam Miller voiced concern that such alerts would not benefit CXOne due to the revenue generated from storage overages.
* **No definitive answer was provided regarding webinar recordings.** Sarah Malone inquired about the availability of webinar recordings for a customer; further investigation is needed to determine the process for accessing these.
* **Chat reskill branches require further clarification.**  David Garcia raised the issue of reskill branches in chat scripts. Adam Miller clarified that while onreskill branches offer control over reskilling behavior, they are not mandatory.  Further investigation by David Garcia will determine if a TASC case is necessary.
* **The question regarding RingCentral partnerships beyond CXOne/Clearview will be addressed by the Account Executive.** Sue Malzacher's query regarding alternative solutions for large call volume and live data reporting will be directed to the appropriate sales representative.


**Action Items:**

* **Steve Mueller:** Investigate existing feature requests for overage alerts and encourage team voting.
* **Sarah Malone:** Follow up on the availability of webinar recordings from 7/29 for the customer.
* **David Garcia:** Investigate the need for a TASC case regarding chat reskill branches; needs deeper investigation into a failed reskill attempt.
* **Sue Malzacher:** Direct the inquiry about RingCentral partnerships to the Account Executive.
* **Hannah Tieu:** Research and respond to the customer's inquiry about the impact of MAX agent EOL on Frontline Agent Console.

The overall tone was collaborative and focused on problem-solving.
