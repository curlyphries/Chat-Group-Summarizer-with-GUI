## RingCentral Team Communication Summary: August 2025

This blog post summarizes key announcements and discussions from a recent RingCentral team chat, covering various projects and urgent issues.


**Key Decisions:**

* **Executive Sponsorship Feedback Due:**  By COB July 31st, all team members must complete the TAM Feedback column in the provided Google Sheet regarding Executive Sponsorship ([link provided](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QeclLeWjjujtvMW4MLTam7iKr1qWlPvt/edit?gid=1315371058#gid=1315371058)).  Detailed feedback is crucial.
* **No Resuming Disabled Freyja Accounts:** A process change mandates that disabled Freyja accounts with a CSM listed in SFDC should not be resumed. Agents should refer such requests to the CSM. This clarification addresses a longstanding, albeit previously undocumented, process.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO) Deployment:**  SSO for all RC users across Userhub instances was deployed on August 14th, affecting logins on August 15th.  Users must now log in via Okta using a tile, following instructions in the provided document ([link provided](https://wiki.ringcentral.com/display/public/RNU/RC+411+News+Update+No.3662+-+Enabling+SSO+for+all+userhub+instances+to+secure+logins#tab-1)).  A temporary workaround was implemented for EU1, for non-BT customers, due to an initial issue. This workaround is resolved.
* **Q4 PS to TAM Handoff in SFDC:**  In Q4, the PS to TAM handoff will be a TAM KPI.  The team should practice completing the associated SFDC tasks throughout Q3 to prepare.


**Action Items:**

* Complete the TAM Feedback spreadsheet by COB July 31st.
* Volunteer to test SSO before full deployment (contact Brian Miller directly).
* Opt-out (or opt-in) customers for the Q3 NPS survey by the August 8th deadline.
* Complete pre-survey outreach by August 22nd. Ensure all necessary documentation for opt-outs is provided.
* Review Service Status Notification Subscription Report ([link not provided]).
* If unable to attend Relationship Survey refresher sessions, contact Niki Martschinske for recordings.
* Practice completing SFDC tasks for the PS to TAM handoff in Q3.
* For Contact Center issues, report any call refusals not noted in the updates. Follow the specified steps post-fix to avoid further issues.


**Team Updates & Discussion:**

* **Service Status Notifications:**  A report detailing the number of subscribed accounts and users for July and June 2025 was shared.
* **Q3 NPS Survey:**  Upcoming milestones and relevant links were shared, emphasizing the importance of pre-survey outreach and the possibility of opting customers back in.
* **Major Incident - CXONE Call Refusals:** A significant incident involving call refusals impacting multiple CXONE clusters was investigated and resolved.  The issue was escalated to Severity 2, and regular updates were provided until a fix was deployed and validated.  Detailed information regarding impacted clusters, case counts, and the resolution process were communicated in real time. This issue was resolved and the root cause identified and a fix deployed.  Users are asked to log out and clear browser caches for continued smooth operation.
* **SSO Rollout:**  Updates regarding the rollout of SSO, including a temporary issue affecting EU1 instances for non-BT customers, and ultimate resolution were shared.



**Overall Sentiment:**

The overall sentiment is one of proactive problem-solving and collaborative effort.  The team actively addressed a major incident, implemented a significant system change (SSO), and prepared for an upcoming key performance indicator (Q4 PS to TAM handoff).  While the major incident caused some concern, the rapid response and successful resolution demonstrate the team's capability to manage and resolve critical issues effectively. The clear communication throughout the incident maintained transparency and kept the team informed.
