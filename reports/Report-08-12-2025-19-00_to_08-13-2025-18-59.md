## RingCentral Team Communication Summary: August 2025

This blog post summarizes key announcements and discussions from a recent team chat, covering various projects and urgent issues.


### Key Decisions

* **Executive Sponsorship Feedback Due:**  By COB July 31st, all team members must complete the TAM Feedback column in the provided Google Sheet ([link provided]), detailing customer sentiment, roadblocks, and positive feedback related to Executive Sponsorship.
* **Freyja Account Process Change:**  Effective immediately, disabled Freyja accounts with a CSM listed in SFDC should not be resumed. Agents should refer such requests to the CSM.  This process, while seemingly new, has been in place since last year.
* **Single Sign-On (SSO) Rollout:** SSO for all RC users across all Userhub instances was successfully implemented on August 14th, impacting logins on August 15th.  Users must now log in via Okta.  A minor initial issue with EU1 access for non-BT customers was quickly resolved.
* **Q3 NPS Survey Opt-Outs Complete:** The deadline for survey opt-outs passed on August 8th, but customers can still opt-in or change their previous opt-out status.  Pre-survey outreach continues through August 22nd.
* **SFDC Task Practice for Q4:** In preparation for Q4 KPIs, team members are encouraged to practice completing SFDC tasks related to the PS to TAM handoff.


### Action Items

* **Complete Executive Sponsorship Feedback:** Populate the Google Sheet ([link provided]) with detailed feedback by COB July 31st.
* **SSO Login:** Familiarize yourself with the new SSO login process via Okta and follow the instructions in the provided wiki ([link provided]). Report any login issues to Brian Miller.
* **Freyja Account Management:**  Adhere to the new process for resuming disabled Freyja accountsâ€”refer requests to the CSM if a CSM is listed in SFDC.
* **Q3 NPS Survey Outreach:** Continue outreach to customers, aiming for genuine engagement and proactive problem-solving before the survey launch.  If a customer wishes to change their opt-out decision, accommodate their request.
* **Practice SFDC Tasks:** Practice completing SFDC tasks for PS to TAM handoffs to prepare for Q4 KPI inclusion.


### Team Updates & Discussion

* **Service Status Notification Report:**  A report detailing the number of subscribed accounts and users for Service Status Notifications was shared, showing steady growth over the past few months ([data provided]).
* **CXONE Platform Call Refusal Issue:** A critical incident involving call refusals for a portion of Contact Center customers was addressed. The issue, impacting numerous clusters, was quickly escalated, diagnosed, a fix deployed, and finally resolved.  The team actively monitored the situation, providing regular updates and ultimately clearing the issue.  Post-resolution steps for end-users were provided.
* **Userhub SSO Deployment:**  Announcements and reminders regarding the SSO implementation for Userhub were provided, including updates on a minor issue with EU1 access for non-BT customers.


### Overall Sentiment

The overall sentiment reflects a proactive and collaborative team effort. While challenges arose (CXONE call refusals), the team effectively responded, resolved issues promptly, and kept each other informed.  A positive attitude towards proactive problem-solving and preparation for upcoming milestones (Q4 KPIs and Q3 NPS survey) was evident.
