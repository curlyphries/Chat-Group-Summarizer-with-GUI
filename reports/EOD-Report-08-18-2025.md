## Key Decisions

* **SSO Enablement for Userhub:** SSO logins were enabled for all Userhub instances on August 14th, impacting logins on August 15th. Users are now required to use Okta tiles for login.
* **Freyja Account Process Change:**  The team will no longer resume disabled Freyja accounts with a CSM listed in SFDC, per direction from leadership and legal. Workarounds are provided for port-out scenarios.
* **Contact Center Call Refusals:** A Sev-2 incident impacting multiple CXONE clusters was identified, investigated, and resolved with a fix deployed on August 12th.  Extensive updates were provided during the incident.
* **SFDC Task Practice for PS to TAM Handoff:** The team will practice completing SFDC tasks for the PS to TAM handoff during Q3, as this will become part of TAM KPIs in Q4.
